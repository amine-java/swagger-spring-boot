# swagger-spring-boot

I have coded this API for the purpose of testing swagger-ui implementation using Spring Boot. It's a simple in-memory API that allows you retrieve, create and update books.

I put this swagger project on Heroku. You can see and walk through the API by visiting this link https://book-api-swagger.herokuapp.com/
